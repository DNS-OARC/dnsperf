%description
dnsperf and resperf are free tools developed by Nominum/Akamai (2006-2018)
and DNS-OARC (since 2019) that make it simple to gather accurate latency and
throughput metrics for Domain Name Service (DNS). These tools are easy-to-use
and simulate typical Internet, so network operators can benchmark their naming
and addressing infrastructure and plan for upgrades. The latest version of
the dnsperf and resperf can be used with test files that include IPv6
queries.

dnsperf "self-paces" the DNS query load to simulate network conditions.

New features in dnsperf improve the precision of latency measurements and
allow for per packet per-query latency reporting is possible. dnsperf is
now multithreaded, multiple dnsperf clients can be supported in multicore
systems (each client requires two cores). The output of dnsperf has also
been improved so it is more concise and useful. Latency data can be used to
make detailed graphs, so it is simple for network operators to take advantage
of the data.

resperf systematically increases the query rate and monitors the response
rate to simulate caching DNS services.

%changelog
* Wed May 06 2020 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.3.3-1
- Release 2.3.3
  * This release changes the behavior of `dnsperf` and `resperf` when it
    comes to TCP and TLS connections, and updates package building using
    COPR (thanks to patch from Petr Menšík (Red Hat)).
  * Connection reset or close are now treated as "try again" so that the
    run is finished and not aborted. As SIGPIPE might be received on usage
    of closed connections it's now blocked in `dnsperf` and handled as
    a fatal action in `resperf`.

* Fri Aug 23 2019 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.3.2-1
- Release 2.3.2
  * This release fixes a buffer overflow when using TSIG and algorithms
    with digests larger then SHA256, reported by Mukund Sivaraman. Also
    fix build dependencies for `sqrt()`.
  * Commits:
    e54aa58 Digest
    bca5d8d sqrt
    d9eaa5b Package
* Wed Jul 24 2019 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.3.1-1
- Release 2.3.1
  * After a report and additional confirming results the use of `poll()` in
    the network receive code for TCP and TLS has been removed. This `poll()`
    initially gave better results while testing in a docker container on
    it's loopback interface but when on physical networks it reduced
    performance to 1/12th, so it had to go.
  * Thanks to Brian Wellington (Akamai/Nominum) for the initial report and
    testing, and to Jan Hák (CZ.NIC) for testing and confirming the results.
  * Bugfix:
    - Fix check for having more DNS messages in the receive buffer for TCP
      and TLS
  * Commits:
    670db9c TCP/TLS receive
    b8925b2 recvbuf have more
* Wed Jul 17 2019 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.3.0-1
- Release 2.3.0
  * This release adds support for DNS over TCP and TLS which can be selected
    by using the mode option for `dnsperf` and `resperf`. The default server
    port used is now determined by the transport mode, udp/tcp port 53 and
    tls port 853.
  * Note that the mode option is different between the program because it was
    already taken for `resperf`.
  * `dnsperf` changes:
    - Add `-m` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add verbose messages about network readiness and congestion
  * `resperf` changes:
    - Add `-M` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add `-v` for verbose mode to report about network readiness and
      congestion
  * Commits:
    ffa49cf LGTM, SonarCloud
    4cd5441 TLS
    35624d1 TCP send, socket ready loop

* Mon Jan 28 2019 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.2.1-1
- Release 2.2.1
  * The commit pulled from a fork that used `inttypes.h`, instead of ISC
    internal types, missed to remove the old conversion specifier.
    This was reported and fixed by Vladimír Čunát.
  * Commits:
    9534ce1 remove visible "u" characters after numbers
* Mon Dec 03 2018 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.2.0-1
