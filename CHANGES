    Release 2.14.0

    This release rewords connection statistics, adds names to threads and
    fixes a bug with using TSIG in more than one thread.

    In "Connection Statistics", reconnections has been renamed to
    connection attempts and now includes both the initial connection
    attempt and following reconnections.

    If supported, threads will now be named after what they do, such as
    "perf-send-<num>" and "perf-recv-<num>".

    The TSIG context was shared between all threads and would case a crash
    if more than one sending thread was used. This has been fixed and TSIG
    contexts are now per thread.

    Release 2.13.1

    This release fixes a few issues with in-progress queries and the TCP
    transport module.

    When using stateful connections, such as TCP, if the full query couldn't
    be sent in one go then the query and connection could get stuck as
    "in-progress".
    This could easily happen if you limited the in-flight queries to 1 and
    sent very large DNS messages using the stream binary format.
    Additional socket ready checks has been added to flush in-progress
    queries as quickly as possible.

    The TCP module's handling of errors when continuing in-progress queries
    has been fixed. Previously it would interpret EAGAIN as an unrecoverable
    error and trigger a reconnect, dropping the quer-y/ies in-progress for
    that connection.

    Other changes:
    - Fix input data buffer to allow for maximum binary blob wire format, 2 byte size + max DNS message
    - Mention PowerTools repository for building on CentOS etc

    Release 2.13.0

    Indication when using TLS transport, currently for DNS-over-TLS and
    DNS-over-HTTPS.

    Release 2.12.0

    This release fixes a segfault when doing DNS-over-HTTPS and changes the
    way maximum queries per second are handled.

    The DNS-over-HTTPS module handled reconnecting incorrectly and destroyed
    the nghttp2 context during callbacks. Thanks to the help from
    @kgillis2000 it was quickly found and fixed.

    The way maximum QPS is handled has been changed by Petr Špaček @pspacek
    (ISC). The new way solves an over-shoot problem that happened due to
    max QPS being counted for the whole runtime and based on completed
    queries, not just sent.

    A new option `qps_threshold_wait` has also been added. This controls
    the threshold for using `nanosleep()` between sending packet and the
    default is measured on start-up. If the time between packets, based on
    max QPS `-Q`, is smaller then no sleep will be performed. This improves
    performance when doing high max QPS limiting.

    Other changes:
    - `dnsperf`: Statistics output
      - Fixed missing connection statistics if only reconnections happened
      - Flush output to allow pipe/grep processing
      - Add percentage on reconnections based on total connections
    - Support OpenSSL 3.0+

    Release 2.11.0

    A couple of new features this release courtesy of Petr Špaček
    @pspacek (ISC) and a bunch of bugfixes.

    First off `dnsperf` can now do verbose statistics during each interval
    when using `-S`, see long option `verbose-interval-stats`.

    Next is a new latency histogram output using data structures (hg64)
    created by Tony Finch @fanf2 (ISC), see long option
    `latency-histogram`. These will also be shown during `-S` when used
    together with `verbose-interval-stats`.

    Lastly a small change to boolean long options, they no longer require
    a value (`=yes`) to be enabled.

    Bugfixes:
    - Make sure the number of outstanding queries don't go negative,
      happens if queries are timed out before being sent
    - Fixed #208:
      - `recv_one()`: Fix handling errno, only store EAGAIN if no other
        error has been received
      - `do_recv()`: Don't break on error as it will count it as a received
        message
      - Treat `EBADF` as `EAGAIN` for stateful connections, receive thread
        might read from a closed socket if send thread is reconnecting
    - `dnsperf`: warn if -c, -T, -q, -Q values are auto-adjusted
    - Fixed #222: don't process unexpected message if the message is
      suppressed

    Release 2.10.0

    This release adds a binary datafile (DNS wire) format to `dnsperf`
    thanks to a contribution from Petr Špaček @pspacek (ISC).

    The new binary format greatly improves performance in some cases, for
    Petr's case it was testing dynamic updates. Switching to this
    pre-compiled DNS wire format increased QPS from 4k to 600k, an increase
    of 150 times throughput from `dnsperf`!

    See man-page for `-B` for more information and examples how to use.

    Release 2.9.0

    This release brings a new message suppression option and a way to control
    how many queries are sent over a connection.

    You can now suppress the message about receiving unexpected DNS message
    IDs by using `-O suppress=unexpected`.

    With `-O num-queries-per-conn=<num>` you can now limit the number of
    queries sent over a connection before triggering a re-connection, see
    the `dnsperf(3)` man-page for more information how this works.

    Release 2.8.0

    This release fixes response handling for DNS-over-HTTPS when multiple
    responses are received within the same receive cycle, and adds a new
    option to suppress some of the normal and verbose output.

    The network model within dnsperf and resperf can not process more then
    one response at a time from a protocol module, so a buffer has been added
    to the DNS-over-HTTPS module to handle this situation (this already exists
    in all other modules).

    The new option `-O suppress=<message,...>` can selectively suppress parts
    of the normal and verbose output. Some of these messages might be
    excessively displayed due to the network model and depending on what
    protocol you use which makes usage harder then necessary. For example
    during TCP connection stage, if you end-point is slow to establish
    connection you will get a lot of output saying that the socket isn't ready
    yet.

2021-08-09 Jerry Lundström

    Release 2.7.0

    This release adds DNS-over-HTTPS support!

    DNS-over-HTTPS can be used by specifying transport mode `doh` and you
    should also look at the dnsperf(1) man-page (or `-H`) for the extended
    options `doh-uri` and `doh-method`, which controls aspects of DoH/HTTP/2
    that you might want to set.

    Other fixes:
    - Add check when constructing DNS packet so that total length of labels
      does not exceed 255 bytes
    - Fix connection/reconnection state handling for DoT transport
    - Fix event handling by initializing them directly when opening the
      sockets, otherwise events could have been missed which would give
      incorrect statistics

2021-03-25 Jerry Lundström

    Release 2.5.2

    This release tweaks the reconnect code for TCP and DoT.

    For TCP, atomic operations are used to signal the need to reconnect
    from the receiving thread to the sending, as the sending is the one in
    charge of reconnecting.
    This speeds up detection of connection lost which reduces the amount of
    lost queries on a disconnect.

    This change does not affect DoT as much, as the SSL context shared
    between the threads are protected by a mutex.
    But a bug was found in `sendto()` for DoT that could drop a query if
    the socket was busy sending.

    The connect and reconnect socket events has been split into connecting,
    connected and reconnecting, reconnected. This is to report more correct
    reconnect events when it comes to DoT, because the connection can be
    lost while negotiating TLS.

    Lastly, additional tests has been added for the network code.

    Release 2.5.1

    This release re-adds support for TYPEnnn and ANY in the datafile, this
    was missed during the removal of the dependency on BINDs development
    libraries in v2.4.0.

    Also note that with v2.5.0, this software now depends on Concurrency
    Kit (ck) for atomic operations.

2021-03-12 Jerry Lundström

    Release 2.5.0

    This release adds re-connection support for TCP and DoT protocol,
    new options to `resperf` and fixes a few bugs.

    `dnsperf` and `resperf` will now try to re-connect when they lose a TCP
    or DoT connection, and with that comes a few new statistics metrics.
    For `dnsperf`, if a connection oriented protocol is used, it will now
    show the total number of re-connections made and the connection latency.
    For `resperf` it also shows the total number of re-connections made and
    the gnuplot data now contains the total number of connections made and
    the connection latency for each interval.
    Beside re-connection support, improvements have been made when it comes
    to tracking socket readiness while connections are established which
    should generate less warnings about "socket not ready".

    New `resperf` options:
    - `-R`: Reopen the datafile if it runs out of data before the testing
      is completed. This allows for long running tests on very small and
      simple query datafile.
    - `-F <fall_behind>`: Sets the maximum number of queries that can fall
      behind being sent. `resperf` will stop when this many queries should
      have been sent and it can be relative easy to hit if `-m <max_qps>`
      is set too high.
      The default is 1000 and setting it to zero (0) disables the check.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed port handling for host/network format when setting client side
      port with `-x`
    - Fix support for quoted characters, `\000` and `\.`, in domain names,
      this was lost when removing BIND's internal development libraries
    - Fix issue in `dnsperf`, it would loop forever if no connection could
      be established
    - Fix potential buffer overrun in `resperf` when using response id
      for `queries[]`
    - DoT: Fix bug when sending from buffer

    Other changes:
    - Always use `IPV6_V6ONLY` socket option for IPv6
    - Add man-page on `-W` option added in v2.4.0
    - Reformat man-pages
    - `resperf`:
      - Try and process more request each run to hopefully not hit max
        outstanding so easy when high QPS
      - Add default value to `-C` so it shows in help

    Release 2.4.2

    This release fixes a few issues with reading of the datafile which
    could lead to "ran out of data" errors.

    The problem was that reading from the datafile was done before finding
    a socket to send it on, or socket readyness, and that lead to progressing
    the queries without really doing anything.
    Another issues that's been fixed was that if the read lines perfectly
    aligned with the buffer, it would be treated like EOF and caused an exit.

    Release 2.4.1

    This release fixes an issue with the socket readiness function that
    could cause a buffer overflow (`-T 10 -c 2000`) due to `select()` being
    limited to check 1023 sockets. `poll()` is now used which has no limit.

    There has also been a few fixes to the contrib script `queryparse` that
    has to do with python v2 and v3 compatibility and better exception
    handling.

    Release 2.4.0

    This release removes the dependency on BIND's internal development
    libraries! This make building and packaging a lot easier and less
    troublesome in the future.

    This software now depends only on OpenSSL (for TSIG feature) with an
    optional depend on LDNS (for dynamic updates feature).

    New option:
    - Transport mode option `-m`/`-M` now recognizes `dot` alongside `tls`
      for encrypted DNS
    - Added `-W` for outputting warnings and errors to stdout

    Other changes / bugfixes:
    - Fix potential memory leak of query descriptions when using verbose
    - Only use TLS v1.2 and above for DoT/TLS
    - Add a lot of tests
    - Add coverage testing

    COPR (thanks to patch from Petr Menšík (Red Hat)).

    Connection reset or close are now treated as "try again" so that the
    run is finished and not aborted. As SIGPIPE might be received on usage
    of closed connections it's now blocked in `dnsperf` and handled as
    a fatal action in `resperf`.

    Release 2.3.1

    After a report and additional confirming results the use of `poll()` in
    the network receive code for TCP and TLS has been removed. This `poll()`
    initially gave better results while testing in a docker container on
    it's loopback interface but when on physical networks it reduced
    performance to 1/12th, so it had to go.

    Thanks to Brian Wellington (Akamai/Nominum) for the initial report and
    testing, and to Jan Hák (CZ.NIC) for testing and confirming the results.

    Bugfix:
    - Fix check for having more DNS messages in the receive buffer for TCP
      and TLS

    Release 2.3.0

    This release adds support for DNS over TCP and TLS which can be selected
    by using the mode option for `dnsperf` and `resperf`. The default server
    port used is now determined by the transport mode, udp/tcp port 53 and
    tls port 853.

    Note that the mode option is different between the program because it was
    already taken for `resperf`.

    `dnsperf` changes:
    - Add `-m` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add verbose messages about network readiness and congestion

    `resperf` changes:
    - Add `-M` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add `-v` for verbose mode to report about network readiness and
      congestion

    Release 2.1.0.0

    In addition to various bug fixes, the following new capabilities
    were added in this release:
    - The `-C` option was added to `resperf`. This option enables the local
      server to act as multiple clients.  By default, the local server
      acts as a single client.
    - the `-T` option was added to `dnsperf`. This option separates the
      number of clients from the number of threads and allows more
      clients to be simulated effectively.  Note that using this option
      impacts CPU and memory, so we recommend limiting the number of
      threads.

    Release 2.0.0.0

    In the `dnsperf` command, the following changes occurred:
    - The socket buffer size is no longer set to 32 kilobytes by default.
    - A new `-c clients` option was added to enable the server to act as
      multiple clients. Each client uses the same source IP address with a
      unique source port. Use the `clients` argument to specify the number of
      clients represented by the server. We recommend limiting the number of
      clients represented by the server because the `dnsperf` process uses two
      threads for each client (one thread for sent packets and one for
      received packets), which impacts CPU and memory.
    - Example query files are no longer included with the `dnsperf` program.
      Nominum provides a sample query file that is available for download at:
      ftp://ftp.nominum.com/pub/nominum/dnsperf/data/
    - Latency reporting improved. When the `-v` (verbose mode) option is
      configured with the `dnsperf` command, the command output now includes
      latency measurements and the DNS RCODE of each response. This enables
      users to create their own latency graphs.
    - Performance was enhanced on modern operating systems so that faster
      name servers can be tested.
    - The `dnsperf` command output is enhanced to display more information in a
      compact format.

    The following options were removed from the `dnsperf` command:
    - The `-A` option for displaying command line arguments passed to the
      `dnsperf` tool in the final statistics output. Now, the `dnsperf` command
      output always displays command line arguments.
    - The `-T` option for printing a histogram showing response latency after
      completing a test run. Now, the `-v` option enables users to include
      latency measurements in the `dnsperf` command output.
    - The `-H` option for configuring the number of buckets for which response
      latency is displayed. Now, the `-v` option enables users to include
      latency measurements in the `dnsperf` command output.
    - The `-1` option for configuring the `dnsperf` tool to run through the input
      file exactly one time. (Now, you use the `-n 1` option to configure the
      `dnsperf` tool to run through the input file one time.)
    - The `-c` option for including the number of responses received (for
      each DNS RCODE) in the final statistics output. Now, DNS RCODE responses
      are always reported.

    In the `resperf` command, the following changes occurred:
    - The socket buffer size is no longer set to 32 kilobytes by default.
    - The `-A` option, which displayed command line arguments passed to the
      `resperf` tool in the final statistics output, was removed. Now, the
      `resperf` command output always displays command line arguments.

    Release 1.0.2.0

    This release adds support for RHEL6-64 and for Solaris 10 x86-64.

    Some new configuration options have been added. You can now specify:
	- the local port from which to send requests
	- the local address from which to send requests
	- the maximum number of runs through the input file, up
	  to the timeout limit.
	- when using TSIG, algorithms other than hmac-md5 can be used.

    One default has been changed:
	- The maximum number of outstanding requests now defaults
	  to 100.

    A new example query file for IPv6, `queryfile-example-ipv6`, is now
    included with the distribution.

    Release 1.0.1.0

    This release makes binary builds of `dnsperf` available in addition to
    the source code version previously released.

    This release of `dnsperf` includes a sample query file containing
    100,000 queries to help with performance testing.  This query file is
    useful for checking latencies or a continuous `dnsperf` run. In the
    binary distribution, this file is found at:

        /usr/local/nom/examples/dnsperf/queryfile-example-100thousand

    In the source distribution, it is at:

        ./examples/queryfile-example-100thousand

    where `.` is the directory made by extracting the source tarball.

    Nominum recommends using a query file with at least 3 million queries
    for a full `resperf` run as described in the man page; we make such a
    file available for download at:

        ftp://ftp.nominum.com/pub/nominum/dnsperf/data/queryfile-example-3million.gz

    The following fix is included in the source distribution:
    - 20996: `makefile.in` does not allow overriding `mandir`
      The `--mandir` argument to `configure`, which allows the user to
      specify the location man pages are installed, was incorrectly
      ignored.

    `queryparse` is a contributed program available in the source
    distribution of `dnsperf`. It can be found at `contrib/queryparse/`.
    The following changes were made to that program:
    - 19717: `contrib/queryparse` includes outgoing queries
      The `queryparse` script had no way of distinguishing between incoming
      queries and outgoing queries when applied to a traffic trace from a
      caching server. This was addressed by adding a new flag (`-r`) that,
      when included in the command line, will keep queries with
      `RD=0`. Otherwise, it will default to discarding them.
    - The ability to parse responses instead of queries was added.
    - A check was added to avoid short packets.
    - Logic was added to detect link type and correctly set the initial
      offset to handle both Ethernet and Cisco HDLC frames.
    - `queryparse` now uses `pcapy` instead of the `btk` python `libcap` module.

    Note that announcements of new releases of `dnsperf` are sent to the
    mailing list: dnsperf-announce@nominum.com.  To be added to the
    mailing list, send a message to dnsperf-announce-request@nominum.com
    with "subscribe" as the subject.

    Known Issues:
    - None.

    Release 1.0.0.1

    This release addresses the following issue in the `dnsperf` program:
    - 18838/18782: `dnsperf` slow down issue
      Because of an error in how timeout checking was being done, queries
      were rarely timing out, so the number of valid queries in flight kept
      dropping.  This error has been corrected.
