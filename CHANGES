    Release 2.3.2

    This release fixes a buffer overflow when using TSIG and algorithms
    with digests larger then SHA256, reported by Mukund Sivaraman. Also
    fix build dependencies for `sqrt()`.

    Release 2.3.1

    After a report and additional confirming results the use of `poll()` in
    the network receive code for TCP and TLS has been removed. This `poll()`
    initially gave better results while testing in a docker container on
    it's loopback interface but when on physical networks it reduced
    performance to 1/12th, so it had to go.

    Thanks to Brian Wellington (Akamai/Nominum) for the initial report and
    testing, and to Jan Hák (CZ.NIC) for testing and confirming the results.

    Bugfix:
    - Fix check for having more DNS messages in the receive buffer for TCP
      and TLS

    Release 2.3.0

    This release adds support for DNS over TCP and TLS which can be selected
    by using the mode option for `dnsperf` and `resperf`. The default server
    port used is now determined by the transport mode, udp/tcp port 53 and
    tls port 853.

    Note that the mode option is different between the program because it was
    already taken for `resperf`.

    `dnsperf` changes:
    - Add `-m` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add verbose messages about network readiness and congestion

    `resperf` changes:
    - Add `-M` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add `-v` for verbose mode to report about network readiness and
      congestion

    Release 2.2.1

    The commit pulled from a fork that used `inttypes.h`, instead of ISC
    internal types, missed to remove the old conversion specifier.
    This was reported and fixed by Vladimír Čunát.

    Release 2.1.0.0

    In addition to various bug fixes, the following new capabilities
    were added in this release:
    - The `-C` option was added to `resperf`. This option enables the local
      server to act as multiple clients.  By default, the local server
      acts as a single client.
    - the `-T` option was added to `dnsperf`. This option separates the
      number of clients from the number of threads and allows more
      clients to be simulated effectively.  Note that using this option
      impacts CPU and memory, so we recommend limiting the number of
      threads.

2012-03-01

    Release 2.0.0.0

    In the `dnsperf` command, the following changes occurred:
    - The socket buffer size is no longer set to 32 kilobytes by default.
    - A new `-c clients` option was added to enable the server to act as
      multiple clients. Each client uses the same source IP address with a
      unique source port. Use the `clients` argument to specify the number of
      clients represented by the server. We recommend limiting the number of
      clients represented by the server because the `dnsperf` process uses two
      threads for each client (one thread for sent packets and one for
      received packets), which impacts CPU and memory.
    - Example query files are no longer included with the `dnsperf` program.
      Nominum provides a sample query file that is available for download at:
      ftp://ftp.nominum.com/pub/nominum/dnsperf/data/
    - Latency reporting improved. When the `-v` (verbose mode) option is
      configured with the `dnsperf` command, the command output now includes
      latency measurements and the DNS RCODE of each response. This enables
      users to create their own latency graphs.
    - Performance was enhanced on modern operating systems so that faster
      name servers can be tested.
    - The `dnsperf` command output is enhanced to display more information in a
      compact format.

    The following options were removed from the `dnsperf` command:
    - The `-A` option for displaying command line arguments passed to the
      `dnsperf` tool in the final statistics output. Now, the `dnsperf` command
      output always displays command line arguments.
    - The `-T` option for printing a histogram showing response latency after
      completing a test run. Now, the `-v` option enables users to include
      latency measurements in the `dnsperf` command output.
    - The `-H` option for configuring the number of buckets for which response
      latency is displayed. Now, the `-v` option enables users to include
      latency measurements in the `dnsperf` command output.
    - The `-1` option for configuring the `dnsperf` tool to run through the input
      file exactly one time. (Now, you use the `-n 1` option to configure the
      `dnsperf` tool to run through the input file one time.)
    - The `-c` option for including the number of responses received (for
      each DNS RCODE) in the final statistics output. Now, DNS RCODE responses
      are always reported.

    In the `resperf` command, the following changes occurred:
    - The socket buffer size is no longer set to 32 kilobytes by default.
    - The `-A` option, which displayed command line arguments passed to the
      `resperf` tool in the final statistics output, was removed. Now, the
      `resperf` command output always displays command line arguments.

    Release 1.0.2.0

    This release adds support for RHEL6-64 and for Solaris 10 x86-64.

    Some new configuration options have been added. You can now specify:
	- the local port from which to send requests
	- the local address from which to send requests
	- the maximum number of runs through the input file, up
	  to the timeout limit.
	- when using TSIG, algorithms other than hmac-md5 can be used.

    One default has been changed:
	- The maximum number of outstanding requests now defaults
	  to 100.

    A new example query file for IPv6, `queryfile-example-ipv6`, is now
    included with the distribution.

2008-01-10

    Release 1.0.1.0

    This release makes binary builds of `dnsperf` available in addition to
    the source code version previously released.

    This release of `dnsperf` includes a sample query file containing
    100,000 queries to help with performance testing.  This query file is
    useful for checking latencies or a continuous `dnsperf` run. In the
    binary distribution, this file is found at:

        /usr/local/nom/examples/dnsperf/queryfile-example-100thousand

    In the source distribution, it is at:

        ./examples/queryfile-example-100thousand

    where `.` is the directory made by extracting the source tarball.

    Nominum recommends using a query file with at least 3 million queries
    for a full `resperf` run as described in the man page; we make such a
    file available for download at:

        ftp://ftp.nominum.com/pub/nominum/dnsperf/data/queryfile-example-3million.gz

    The following fix is included in the source distribution:
    - 20996: `makefile.in` does not allow overriding `mandir`
      The `--mandir` argument to `configure`, which allows the user to
      specify the location man pages are installed, was incorrectly
      ignored.

    `queryparse` is a contributed program available in the source
    distribution of `dnsperf`. It can be found at `contrib/queryparse/`.
    The following changes were made to that program:
    - 19717: `contrib/queryparse` includes outgoing queries
      The `queryparse` script had no way of distinguishing between incoming
      queries and outgoing queries when applied to a traffic trace from a
      caching server. This was addressed by adding a new flag (`-r`) that,
      when included in the command line, will keep queries with
      `RD=0`. Otherwise, it will default to discarding them.
    - The ability to parse responses instead of queries was added.
    - A check was added to avoid short packets.
    - Logic was added to detect link type and correctly set the initial
      offset to handle both Ethernet and Cisco HDLC frames.
    - `queryparse` now uses `pcapy` instead of the `btk` python `libcap` module.

    Note that announcements of new releases of `dnsperf` are sent to the
    mailing list: dnsperf-announce@nominum.com.  To be added to the
    mailing list, send a message to dnsperf-announce-request@nominum.com
    with "subscribe" as the subject.

    Known Issues:
    - None.

    Release 1.0.0.1

    This release addresses the following issue in the `dnsperf` program:
    - 18838/18782: `dnsperf` slow down issue
      Because of an error in how timeout checking was being done, queries
      were rarely timing out, so the number of valid queries in flight kept
      dropping.  This error has been corrected.
