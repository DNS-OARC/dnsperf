Description: DNS Performance Testing Tool
 dnsperf and resperf are free tools developed by Nominum/Akamai (2006-2018)
 and DNS-OARC (since 2019) that make it simple to gather accurate latency and
 throughput metrics for Domain Name Service (DNS). These tools are easy-to-use
 and simulate typical Internet, so network operators can benchmark their naming
 and addressing infrastructure and plan for upgrades. The latest version of
 the dnsperf and resperf can be used with test files that include IPv6
 queries.
 .
 dnsperf "self-paces" the DNS query load to simulate network conditions.
 .
 New features in dnsperf improve the precision of latency measurements and
 allow for per packet per-query latency reporting is possible. dnsperf is
 now multithreaded, multiple dnsperf clients can be supported in multicore
 systems (each client requires two cores). The output of dnsperf has also
 been improved so it is more concise and useful. Latency data can be used to
 make detailed graphs, so it is simple for network operators to take advantage
 of the data.

Description: DNS Resolution Performance Testing Tool
 dnsperf and resperf are free tools developed by Nominum/Akamai (2006-2018)

 .
 resperf systematically increases the query rate and monitors the response
 rate to simulate caching DNS services.
