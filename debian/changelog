dnsperf (2.5.2-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.5.2

    This release tweaks the reconnect code for TCP and DoT.

    For TCP, atomic operations are used to signal the need to reconnect
    from the receiving thread to the sending, as the sending is the one in
    charge of reconnecting.
    This speeds up detection of connection lost which reduces the amount of
    lost queries on a disconnect.

    This change does not affect DoT as much, as the SSL context shared
    between the threads are protected by a mutex.
    But a bug was found in `sendto()` for DoT that could drop a query if
    the socket was busy sending.

    The connect and reconnect socket events has been split into connecting,
    connected and reconnecting, reconnected. This is to report more correct
    reconnect events when it comes to DoT, because the connection can be
    lost while negotiating TLS.

    Lastly, additional tests has been added for the network code.

dnsperf (2.5.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.5.1

    This release re-adds support for TYPEnnn and ANY in the datafile, this
    was missed during the removal of the dependency on BINDs development
    libraries in v2.4.0.

    Also note that with v2.5.0, this software now depends on Concurrency
    Kit (ck) for atomic operations.

dnsperf (2.5.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.5.0

    This release adds re-connection support for TCP and DoT protocol,
    new options to `resperf` and fixes a few bugs.

    `dnsperf` and `resperf` will now try to re-connect when they lose a TCP
    or DoT connection, and with that comes a few new statistics metrics.
    For `dnsperf`, if a connection oriented protocol is used, it will now
    show the total number of re-connections made and the connection latency.
    For `resperf` it also shows the total number of re-connections made and
    the gnuplot data now contains the total number of connections made and
    the connection latency for each interval.
    Beside re-connection support, improvements have been made when it comes
    to tracking socket readiness while connections are established which
    should generate less warnings about "socket not ready".

    New `resperf` options:
    - `-R`: Reopen the datafile if it runs out of data before the testing
      is completed. This allows for long running tests on very small and
      simple query datafile.
    - `-F <fall_behind>`: Sets the maximum number of queries that can fall
      behind being sent. `resperf` will stop when this many queries should
      have been sent and it can be relative easy to hit if `-m <max_qps>`
      is set too high.
      The default is 1000 and setting it to zero (0) disables the check.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed port handling for host/network format when setting client side
      port with `-x`
    - Fix support for quoted characters, `\000` and `\.`, in domain names,
      this was lost when removing BIND's internal development libraries
    - Fix issue in `dnsperf`, it would loop forever if no connection could
      be established
    - Fix potential buffer overrun in `resperf` when using response id
      for `queries[]`
    - DoT: Fix bug when sending from buffer

    Other changes:
    - Always use `IPV6_V6ONLY` socket option for IPv6
    - Add man-page on `-W` option added in v2.4.0
    - Reformat man-pages
    - `resperf`:
      - Try and process more request each run to hopefully not hit max
        outstanding so easy when high QPS
      - Add default value to `-C` so it shows in help

dnsperf (2.4.2-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.4.2

    This release fixes a few issues with reading of the datafile which
    could lead to "ran out of data" errors.

    The problem was that reading from the datafile was done before finding
    a socket to send it on, or socket readyness, and that lead to progressing
    the queries without really doing anything.
    Another issues that's been fixed was that if the read lines perfectly
    aligned with the buffer, it would be treated like EOF and caused an exit.

dnsperf (2.4.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.4.1

    This release fixes an issue with the socket readiness function that
    could cause a buffer overflow (`-T 10 -c 2000`) due to `select()` being
    limited to check 1023 sockets. `poll()` is now used which has no limit.

    There has also been a few fixes to the contrib script `queryparse` that
    has to do with python v2 and v3 compatibility and better exception
    handling.

dnsperf (2.4.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.4.0

    This release removes the dependency on BIND's internal development
    libraries! This make building and packaging a lot easier and less
    troublesome in the future.

    This software now depends only on OpenSSL (for TSIG feature) with an
    optional depend on LDNS (for dynamic updates feature).

    New option:
    - Transport mode option `-m`/`-M` now recognizes `dot` alongside `tls`
      for encrypted DNS
    - Added `-W` for outputting warnings and errors to stdout

    Other changes / bugfixes:
    - Fix potential memory leak of query descriptions when using verbose
    - Only use TLS v1.2 and above for DoT/TLS
    - Add a lot of tests
    - Add coverage testing

  * Release 2.3.4

    This release adds a workaround, thanks to patch from Petr Menšík, for
    building on systems with BIND 9.16. Also improves error handling by
    using thread-safe `strerror_r()` instead of `strerror()`.

dnsperf (2.3.3-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.3

    This release changes the behavior of `dnsperf` and `resperf` when it
    comes to TCP and TLS connections, and updates package building using
    COPR (thanks to patch from Petr Menšík (Red Hat)).

    Connection reset or close are now treated as "try again" so that the
    run is finished and not aborted. As SIGPIPE might be received on usage
    of closed connections it's now blocked in `dnsperf` and handled as
    a fatal action in `resperf`.

dnsperf (2.3.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.1

    After a report and additional confirming results the use of `poll()` in
    the network receive code for TCP and TLS has been removed. This `poll()`
    initially gave better results while testing in a docker container on
    it's loopback interface but when on physical networks it reduced
    performance to 1/12th, so it had to go.

    Thanks to Brian Wellington (Akamai/Nominum) for the initial report and
    testing, and to Jan Hák (CZ.NIC) for testing and confirming the results.

    Bugfix:
    - Fix check for having more DNS messages in the receive buffer for TCP
      and TLS

dnsperf (2.3.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.0

    This release adds support for DNS over TCP and TLS which can be selected
    by using the mode option for `dnsperf` and `resperf`. The default server
    port used is now determined by the transport mode, udp/tcp port 53 and
    tls port 853.

    Note that the mode option is different between the program because it was
    already taken for `resperf`.

    `dnsperf` changes:
    - Add `-m` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add verbose messages about network readiness and congestion

    `resperf` changes:
    - Add `-M` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add `-v` for verbose mode to report about network readiness and
      congestion
