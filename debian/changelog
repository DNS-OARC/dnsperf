dnsperf (2.3.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.1

    After a report and additional confirming results the use of `poll()` in
    the network receive code for TCP and TLS has been removed. This `poll()`
    initially gave better results while testing in a docker container on
    it's loopback interface but when on physical networks it reduced
    performance to 1/12th, so it had to go.

    Thanks to Brian Wellington (Akamai/Nominum) for the initial report and
    testing, and to Jan Hák (CZ.NIC) for testing and confirming the results.

    Bugfix:
    - Fix check for having more DNS messages in the receive buffer for TCP
      and TLS

    b8925b2 recvbuf have more

dnsperf (2.3.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.0

    This release adds support for DNS over TCP and TLS which can be selected
    by using the mode option for `dnsperf` and `resperf`. The default server
    port used is now determined by the transport mode, udp/tcp port 53 and
    tls port 853.

    Note that the mode option is different between the program because it was
    already taken for `resperf`.

    `dnsperf` changes:
    - Add `-m` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add verbose messages about network readiness and congestion

    `resperf` changes:
    - Add `-M` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add `-v` for verbose mode to report about network readiness and
      congestion

dnsperf (2.2.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.2.1

    The commit pulled from a fork that used `inttypes.h`, instead of ISC
    internal types, missed to remove the old conversion specifier.
    This was reported and fixed by Vladimír Čunát.
