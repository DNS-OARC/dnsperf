dnsperf (2.14.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.14.0

    This release rewords connection statistics, adds names to threads and
    fixes a bug with using TSIG in more than one thread.

    In "Connection Statistics", reconnections has been renamed to
    connection attempts and now includes both the initial connection
    attempt and following reconnections.

    If supported, threads will now be named after what they do, such as
    "perf-send-<num>" and "perf-recv-<num>".

    The TSIG context was shared between all threads and would case a crash
    if more than one sending thread was used. This has been fixed and TSIG
    contexts are now per thread.

dnsperf (2.13.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.13.1

    This release fixes a few issues with in-progress queries and the TCP
    transport module.

    When using stateful connections, such as TCP, if the full query couldn't
    be sent in one go then the query and connection could get stuck as
    "in-progress".
    This could easily happen if you limited the in-flight queries to 1 and
    sent very large DNS messages using the stream binary format.
    Additional socket ready checks has been added to flush in-progress
    queries as quickly as possible.

    The TCP module's handling of errors when continuing in-progress queries
    has been fixed. Previously it would interpret EAGAIN as an unrecoverable
    error and trigger a reconnect, dropping the quer-y/ies in-progress for
    that connection.

    Other changes:
    - Fix input data buffer to allow for maximum binary blob wire format, 2 byte size + max DNS message
    - Mention PowerTools repository for building on CentOS etc

dnsperf (2.12.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.12.0

    This release fixes a segfault when doing DNS-over-HTTPS and changes the
    way maximum queries per second are handled.

    The DNS-over-HTTPS module handled reconnecting incorrectly and destroyed
    the nghttp2 context during callbacks. Thanks to the help from
    @kgillis2000 it was quickly found and fixed.

    The way maximum QPS is handled has been changed by Petr Špaček @pspacek
    (ISC). The new way solves an over-shoot problem that happened due to
    max QPS being counted for the whole runtime and based on completed
    queries, not just sent.

    A new option `qps_threshold_wait` has also been added. This controls
    the threshold for using `nanosleep()` between sending packet and the
    default is measured on start-up. If the time between packets, based on
    max QPS `-Q`, is smaller then no sleep will be performed. This improves
    performance when doing high max QPS limiting.

    Other changes:
    - `dnsperf`: Statistics output
      - Fixed missing connection statistics if only reconnections happened
      - Flush output to allow pipe/grep processing
      - Add percentage on reconnections based on total connections
    - Support OpenSSL 3.0+

dnsperf (2.11.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.11.0

    A couple of new features this release courtesy of Petr Špaček
    @pspacek (ISC) and a bunch of bugfixes.

    First off `dnsperf` can now do verbose statistics during each interval
    when using `-S`, see long option `verbose-interval-stats`.

    Next is a new latency histogram output using data structures (hg64)
    created by Tony Finch @fanf2 (ISC), see long option
    `latency-histogram`. These will also be shown during `-S` when used
    together with `verbose-interval-stats`.

    Lastly a small change to boolean long options, they no longer require
    a value (`=yes`) to be enabled.

    Bugfixes:
    - Make sure the number of outstanding queries don't go negative,
      happens if queries are timed out before being sent
    - Fixed #208:
      - `recv_one()`: Fix handling errno, only store EAGAIN if no other
        error has been received
      - `do_recv()`: Don't break on error as it will count it as a received
        message
      - Treat `EBADF` as `EAGAIN` for stateful connections, receive thread
        might read from a closed socket if send thread is reconnecting
    - `dnsperf`: warn if -c, -T, -q, -Q values are auto-adjusted
    - Fixed #222: don't process unexpected message if the message is
      suppressed

dnsperf (2.10.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.10.0

    This release adds a binary datafile (DNS wire) format to `dnsperf`
    thanks to a contribution from Petr Špaček @pspacek (ISC).

    The new binary format greatly improves performance in some cases, for
    Petr's case it was testing dynamic updates. Switching to this
    pre-compiled DNS wire format increased QPS from 4k to 600k, an increase
    of 150 times throughput from `dnsperf`!

    See man-page for `-B` for more information and examples how to use.

dnsperf (2.9.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.9.0

    This release brings a new message suppression option and a way to control
    how many queries are sent over a connection.

    You can now suppress the message about receiving unexpected DNS message
    IDs by using `-O suppress=unexpected`.

    With `-O num-queries-per-conn=<num>` you can now limit the number of
    queries sent over a connection before triggering a re-connection, see
    the `dnsperf(3)` man-page for more information how this works.

dnsperf (2.8.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.8.0

    This release fixes response handling for DNS-over-HTTPS when multiple
    responses are received within the same receive cycle, and adds a new
    option to suppress some of the normal and verbose output.

    The network model within dnsperf and resperf can not process more then
    one response at a time from a protocol module, so a buffer has been added
    to the DNS-over-HTTPS module to handle this situation (this already exists
    in all other modules).

    The new option `-O suppress=<message,...>` can selectively suppress parts
    of the normal and verbose output. Some of these messages might be
    excessively displayed due to the network model and depending on what
    protocol you use which makes usage harder then necessary. For example
    during TCP connection stage, if you end-point is slow to establish
    connection you will get a lot of output saying that the socket isn't ready
    yet.

dnsperf (2.7.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.7.0

    This release adds DNS-over-HTTPS support!

    DNS-over-HTTPS can be used by specifying transport mode `doh` and you
    should also look at the dnsperf(1) man-page (or `-H`) for the extended
    options `doh-uri` and `doh-method`, which controls aspects of DoH/HTTP/2
    that you might want to set.

    Other fixes:
    - Add check when constructing DNS packet so that total length of labels
      does not exceed 255 bytes
    - Fix connection/reconnection state handling for DoT transport
    - Fix event handling by initializing them directly when opening the
      sockets, otherwise events could have been missed which would give
      incorrect statistics

dnsperf (2.5.2-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.5.2

    This release tweaks the reconnect code for TCP and DoT.

    For TCP, atomic operations are used to signal the need to reconnect
    from the receiving thread to the sending, as the sending is the one in
    charge of reconnecting.
    This speeds up detection of connection lost which reduces the amount of
    lost queries on a disconnect.

    This change does not affect DoT as much, as the SSL context shared
    between the threads are protected by a mutex.
    But a bug was found in `sendto()` for DoT that could drop a query if
    the socket was busy sending.

    The connect and reconnect socket events has been split into connecting,
    connected and reconnecting, reconnected. This is to report more correct
    reconnect events when it comes to DoT, because the connection can be
    lost while negotiating TLS.

    Lastly, additional tests has been added for the network code.

dnsperf (2.5.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.5.0

    This release adds re-connection support for TCP and DoT protocol,
    new options to `resperf` and fixes a few bugs.

    `dnsperf` and `resperf` will now try to re-connect when they lose a TCP
    or DoT connection, and with that comes a few new statistics metrics.
    For `dnsperf`, if a connection oriented protocol is used, it will now
    show the total number of re-connections made and the connection latency.
    For `resperf` it also shows the total number of re-connections made and
    the gnuplot data now contains the total number of connections made and
    the connection latency for each interval.
    Beside re-connection support, improvements have been made when it comes
    to tracking socket readiness while connections are established which
    should generate less warnings about "socket not ready".

    New `resperf` options:
    - `-R`: Reopen the datafile if it runs out of data before the testing
      is completed. This allows for long running tests on very small and
      simple query datafile.
    - `-F <fall_behind>`: Sets the maximum number of queries that can fall
      behind being sent. `resperf` will stop when this many queries should
      have been sent and it can be relative easy to hit if `-m <max_qps>`
      is set too high.
      The default is 1000 and setting it to zero (0) disables the check.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed port handling for host/network format when setting client side
      port with `-x`
    - Fix support for quoted characters, `\000` and `\.`, in domain names,
      this was lost when removing BIND's internal development libraries
    - Fix issue in `dnsperf`, it would loop forever if no connection could
      be established
    - Fix potential buffer overrun in `resperf` when using response id
      for `queries[]`
    - DoT: Fix bug when sending from buffer

    Other changes:
    - Always use `IPV6_V6ONLY` socket option for IPv6
    - Add man-page on `-W` option added in v2.4.0
    - Reformat man-pages
    - `resperf`:
      - Try and process more request each run to hopefully not hit max
        outstanding so easy when high QPS
      - Add default value to `-C` so it shows in help

dnsperf (2.4.2-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.4.2

    This release fixes a few issues with reading of the datafile which
    could lead to "ran out of data" errors.

    The problem was that reading from the datafile was done before finding
    a socket to send it on, or socket readyness, and that lead to progressing
    the queries without really doing anything.
    Another issues that's been fixed was that if the read lines perfectly
    aligned with the buffer, it would be treated like EOF and caused an exit.

    handling.

    initially gave better results while testing in a docker container on
    it's loopback interface but when on physical networks it reduced

dnsperf (2.3.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.3.0

    This release adds support for DNS over TCP and TLS which can be selected
    by using the mode option for `dnsperf` and `resperf`. The default server
    port used is now determined by the transport mode, udp/tcp port 53 and
    tls port 853.

    Note that the mode option is different between the program because it was
    already taken for `resperf`.

    `dnsperf` changes:
    - Add `-m` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add verbose messages about network readiness and congestion

    `resperf` changes:
    - Add `-M` for setting transport mode, `udp` (default), `tcp` or `tls`
    - Add `-v` for verbose mode to report about network readiness and
      congestion

dnsperf (2.2.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 2.2.1

    The commit pulled from a fork that used `inttypes.h`, instead of ISC
    internal types, missed to remove the old conversion specifier.
    This was reported and fixed by Vladimír Čunát.
